# Doodle-Clone
A collaborative project to create a Doodle Poll clone. 
Creators: Justin Roderman, Alex Kuntz, Harrison Luo, Varun Chadha, and Noah Brabec.

## Getting Started
Our doodle clone is based from a webserver so there is no need for any installation. All you need to do is click [here](#someweblink) and take a look around. 

## How to Use Doodle Clone
Doodle-Clone is a scheduling service that allows users to view upcoming events and vote on when they are availible to attend. You can also set tasks that need to be completed for each event and users can sign up to complete those tasks. This allows managers and admins to accurately plan when to host group events. 

### For General Users
General Users are anyone who uses the Doodle-Clone service. They will be able to log into the website, view events, vote on when they can go, and sign up for tasks for events.
